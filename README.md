# Observability Icons

This repository offers icons to describe the [different types of observability signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/) inspired by current and (hopefully) future [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) features.

## Why share these icons?

While preparing a talk for the [AWS Community Day Netherlands](https://awscommunityday.nl/), we felt we lacked a graphical way to intuitively convey the basic concepts of observability to people familiar with operating software, metrics, logs, distributed tracing, etc.

We could not find images we could freely reuse, so we came up with some.
And we hope you won't have to do the same in the future.

Enjoy, and make excellent software with excellent observability!

With love,
